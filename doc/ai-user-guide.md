# AI Assistant User Guide

The AI Assistant is designed to help you set up and optimize your product customizations quickly and efficiently.

## How to Access

You can find the AI Assistant bubble in the bottom-right corner of your Admin Dashboard. 

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Setup
Ask the AI to set up a new product. For example:
> "Help me set up configuration for a T-shirt product."

The AI will suggest appropriate tools like text layers, image uploads, and safe areas.

### 2. Instant Troubleshooting
If something isn't working, ask the AI to check your product:
> "Why is the customizer not showing up on product X?"

The AI will run diagnostics and suggest fixes like setting canvas dimensions or adding a print area.

### 3. Optimization Recommendations
The AI proactively looks for ways to improve your customers' experience. You might see suggestions to:
*   Increase canvas resolution for better print quality.
*   Add safe areas to prevent design cut-offs.
*   Suggest popular font pairings for better aesthetics.

### 4. Bulk Operations (Coming Soon)
Apply settings to multiple products at once by asking the AI.

## Security & Safety

*   **You are in Control**: The AI will never change your data without your explicit approval via the "Approve & Execute" button.
*   **Safe Data**: The AI only has access to your product configuration data. It cannot access your financial information or modify your website's code.
*   **Isolation**: Your data is yours alone. The AI is securely isolated to your shop's context.
